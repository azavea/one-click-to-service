# One Click to Service

[One Click to Service](header.png)

If you spend any amount of time in the AWS console UI you have my deepest sympathies. They've recently started rolling out "improvements" to the UI by changing it - or rearranging buttons and information from where you used to expect it while adding _new_ frustrating bugs (:wave: cloning jobs in Batch).

In an attempt to make navigating services slightly less painful I've created this extension to restore the removed "bookmark" behavior. Now when you favorite services in the services drop down they will be populated in the page's header. You have to refresh the page after favoriting new services, but after that they should show up as you navigate.

If you find a bug or have ideas for how to extend or improve other parts of the AWS console please create an issue and I'll see what I can do!
